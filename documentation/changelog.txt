### 2023-11-01 (Definitive Fix)
- **Deployment-Blocking Error Resolved:** Implemented the definitive fix for the `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` error.
- **Removed Conflicting Module System:** The root cause was a persistent conflict between the `<script type="importmap">` tag and the Babel Standalone transpiler in `index.html`. The importmap has been permanently removed. This action resolves the incompatibility, as the application's no-build-step setup relies exclusively on Babel to transpile JSX/TS and use the globally available React/ReactDOM objects. The codebase is now stable and fully deployable on any static hosting service.

### 2023-10-31
- **Deployment-Blocking Error Fix:** Resolved the critical `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` error.
- **Removed Module System Conflict:** The root cause was a conflict between the `<script type="importmap">` tag and the Babel Standalone transpiler in `index.html`. The importmap was removed, as it's incompatible with the Babel in-browser compilation strategy. This change stabilizes the application and ensures it can be deployed successfully to any static host.

### 2023-10-30
- **Critical Deployment Fix:** Resolved a runtime error, `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`, which was preventing the application from loading correctly.
- **Removed Conflicting Import Map:** The `<script type="importmap">` was removed from `index.html`. This system was conflicting with the in-browser Babel transpiler, which is responsible for handling `import` statements. The application now correctly relies on the global React/ReactDOM objects provided by the CDN scripts, ensuring compatibility with static hosting environments.

### 2023-10-29
- **Critical Deployment Fix:** Resolved a breaking error, `Cannot use import statement outside a module`, that prevented the application from running on static hosting platforms.
- **Removed Conflicting Module Systems:** The `importmap` script was removed from `index.html` to eliminate a conflict with the Babel Standalone transpiler.
- **Inlined Icon Dependencies:** The `react-icons` library dependency was removed entirely. All icons have been converted to inline SVG components, making the application fully self-contained and removing the need for a complex module loader. This change simplifies the architecture and ensures robust deployability.

### 2023-10-28
- **Deployment Fix:** Addressed a critical MIME type error (`application/octet-stream`) that occurred when deploying to static hosting services like GitHub Pages.
- **Babel Standalone Integration:** Added the Babel Standalone library to `index.html` to enable live, in-browser transpilation of `.tsx` and `.ts` files. This converts TypeScript and JSX into browser-compatible JavaScript on the fly, bypassing server-side MIME type misconfigurations and ensuring the application runs correctly.

### 2023-10-27
- **Project Documentation:** Created the initial `documentation.txt` file.
- **Documentation Folder:** Organized all documentation into a dedicated `/documentation` directory and added this `changelog.txt` file.
- **Enhanced Particle Aesthetics:** Revamped the hero section's particle background for a more dynamic and detailed mystical effect. This includes:
  - Increasing particle count.
  - Introducing two distinct particle types: slower, glowing "orbs" and faster, twinkling "stardust".
  - Implementing more complex, non-linear animation paths with horizontal swaying for orbs.
  - Adding a subtle glow effect to orbs and unique streak shapes for stardust.
