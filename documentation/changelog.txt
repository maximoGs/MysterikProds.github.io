- **Project Documentation:** Created the initial `documentation.txt` file.
- **Documentation Folder:** Organized all documentation into a dedicated `/documentation` directory and added this `changelog.txt` file.
- **Enhanced Particle Aesthetics:** Revamped the hero section's particle background for a more dynamic and detailed mystical effect. This includes:
  - Increasing particle count.
  - Introducing two distinct particle types: slower, glowing "orbs" and faster, twinkling "stardust".
  - Implementing more complex, non-linear animation paths with horizontal swaying for orbs.
  - Adding a subtle glow effect to orbs and unique streak shapes for stardust.
