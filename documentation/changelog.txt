### 2023-11-08 (Definitive Deployment Architecture Fix)
- **Error Resolved:** Fixed the root cause of all deployment issues, including `Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node'`, `Unexpected token 'export'`, and `Cannot use import statement outside a module`.
- **Removed All ES6 Modules:** The core issue was a conflict between the use of ES6 `import`/`export` statements and the project's no-build-step, CDN-based architecture. All `import` and `export` statements have been removed from every `.ts` and `.tsx` file.
- **Removed Import Map:** The conflicting `<script type="importmap">` tag was removed from `index.html`.
- **Architectural Alignment:** The codebase now correctly relies on the sequential loading of scripts and the global availability of `React`, `ReactDOM`, and all custom components, hooks, and types. This aligns the code with its execution environment, ensuring stability and successful deployment on any static hosting service.
